        <div id="paragraph">Hi! My name is Patrick Dunn and I’m an aspiring Web Developer.</div>
        <div id="paragraph">If you had asked me four years ago what I wanted to do, I wouldn’t have said web development. The field wasn’t even on my radar screen. Four years ago I was a junior in college, studying Spanish and Economics. But a difficult personal situation blindsided me in the winter of 2016 and set me on a new path. While I initially wanted to drop out of college, I decided to persevere and graduate with my Spanish degree.</div>
        <div id="paragraph">I moved back home and worked as carpenter for 2 years while I figured out what was next. After I paid off my student loans I couldn’t ignore the call to adventure any longer. So I completed a TEFL (Teaching English as a Foreign Language) Certificate and moved to Mexico.</div>
        <div id="paragraph">I lived in a bustling city called Querétaro for nine months. I rented a room from a family less than a mile from the University of Querétaro. I bought a motorcycle, took German classes, and began training Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. I traveled all around the Central Highlands and even spent 10 days crisscrossing the Yucatan Peninsula from Mérida to Bacalar. It was a wonderful time and I will cherish the memories of those nine months for the rest of my life.</div>
        <div id="paragraph">While teaching English in Mexico was exciting, it wasn’t a career. Some students were a joy to teach while others were not so much. I didn’t feel challenged. The pay, while plenty for a single man in his 20’s, wouldn’t support a family. I needed a change.</div>
        <div id="paragraph">I moved back to Connecticut in June 2019. I considered law school and even took the LSAT. But the crushing cost of legal education combined with no great intrinsic desire to practice law pushed me to find something else.</div>
        <div id="paragraph">I came across an advertisement for the coding bootcamp at UCONN and looked into web development. It checks a lot of boxes for me. I enjoy constructing logical systems. It’s a career path that requires constant learning. The industry is booming. It will allow me to have a family someday. And similar to carpentry, it’s satisfying to finish building something and <strong>it works.</strong></div>
        <div id="paragraph">While I’m only beginning my coding journey, I’m exhilarated by what I’ve learned so far. Little by little I’m seeing how this world of <divs> and <headers> allow the modern world to function. It think it’s exciting to be a part of building the internet.</div>
